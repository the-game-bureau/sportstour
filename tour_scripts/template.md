Opening Rally Point: The 24-Hour Truce
Standard Introduction Script
"Welcome to [HOME CITY], [AWAY TEAM] fans! I'm your guide, and like Owen Wilson in Behind Enemy Lines, you've just parachuted into hostile territory. But unlike that movie, I'm here to help you survive AND enjoy it. While tomorrow we'll be mortal enemies for about four hours, right now I'm calling an official 24-hour truce. Consider me your diplomatic ambassador – I'll show you the best of our city, share some trash talk that's actually educational, and help you understand why [HOME CITY] is obviously superior... I mean, different from [AWAY CITY]. By the end of this tour, you'll either love us or at least respect us enough to hate us properly!"

Timing: Exactly 24 hours before kickoff
Group Size: 15-25 people optimal
Style: Where rivalry meets respect
Booking: Via thegamebureau.com or missioncontrol@thegamebureau.com


THE PHILOSOPHY: Sports as Acceptable Hatred
Core Messaging
"Sports is perhaps the last arena where passionate hatred is not only acceptable, but celebrated. Like Any Given Sunday, it's about the inches we fight for, the passion that drives us, and the beautiful animosity that defines true fandom. Yet beneath every rivalry lies a deeper truth: we're all united by our love for the game itself."
Tour Principles

Friendly Tête-à-Tête: That special conversation that only happens between opposing fans
Understanding the Enemy: Learn what drives their passion (Know your enemy - Sun Tzu)
Common Ground: We all fell in love with something bigger than ourselves
The Best Conversations: Sometimes happen with the "enemy"
